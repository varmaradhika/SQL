# 🇮🇳 India General Elections 2024 - SQL Analysis

## 📋 Project Title:
**India General Elections Result Analysis 2024**



## 📌 About This Project:
This project is based on the **2024 Indian General Election Results**, analyzed using **SQL**. It includes queries to explore:

- Total seats and state-wise seat distribution  
- Performance of major alliances like **NDA**, **I.N.D.I.A.**, and **Others**  
- Top parties and candidates by votes  
- EVM vs Postal vote distribution  
- Winning & runner-up candidates in each constituency  
- Detailed insights for specific states like **Maharashtra**



## 🧠 What I Learned:
- Writing complex **SQL queries**
- Using **JOINs**, **GROUP BY**, and **ORDER BY**
- Applying **CASE** statements and **CTEs** (Common Table Expressions)
- Modifying tables with `ALTER` and `UPDATE`
- Getting valuable insights from election data


## 🗃️ Database Tables Used:
- `partywise_results`
- `constituencywise_results`
- `constituencywise_details`
- `statewise_results`
- `states`


## 🧾 Sample Questions Solved:
- How many total seats were there?
- Which party won the most seats in each state?
- How many seats were won by NDA and I.N.D.I.A?
- Who was the top candidate by EVM votes?
- What is the vote difference between winner and runner-up in a constituency?



## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
- SQL Server / MySQL
- SQL queries only (no programming used)
- Word document used for query documentation





## ✅ Conclusion:
This project helped me practice SQL by working on real election data. I learned how to write meaningful queries, use functions and joins, and present insights clearly. It gave me confidence to move forward in the data analysis field.

I plan to improve this project in the future by adding **visual dashboards** using **Power BI** or **Python**. 🚀
